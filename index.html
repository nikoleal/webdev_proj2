    <h2>Future Career</h2>
    <p>After graduating from high school and college I want to be a Computer Engineer making microchips. My passion for Computer Engineering began at my first PC build. After going to a local VR store with my brother to try out their setup and play their games, I got to know the owner, who was a hardware engineer fresh out of college. He taught me how computers worked and how he built them and it was the coolest thing Iâ€™d ever seen. I had always enjoyed tinkering but making my computer would top all of that. After I had finished building it and experienced first-hand how it was made, I was hooked.

    <h2>Potential Future Employers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>NVIDIA</li>
      <li>AMD</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These future employers interest me because they specialize in technology and are in constant need of better technology to beat out their competitors. I want to be a person who helps make a new and better processor.</p>
