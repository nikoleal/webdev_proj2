        <h2>Electronics and Microchips</h2>
        <p>
          One of my primary hobbies is delving into the world of electronics,
          especially microchips. I enjoy understanding how they work,
          from their basic logic gates to complex architectures. I spend
          time experimenting with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
          building small circuits, and learning about embedded systems programming.

          This fascination extends to reading about the latest advancements
          in semiconductor technology and trying to grasp the intricate
          details of chip design. It's a challenging yet rewarding hobby
          that perfectly complements my interest in computer engineering.

        <h2>Reading and Learning</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not tinkering with electronics, I'm usually found with a
          book or an online course. I have a broad interest in non-fiction,
          particularly in areas like history, science, and philosophy.
          I believe that continuous learning is key to personal and
          professional growth. I also enjoy reading about new programming
          languages and software development methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy reading fiction, especially sci-fi and fantasy,
          as a way to relax and explore imaginative worlds. It's a great way
          to unwind and get inspired.
